# annotate_scanned_document

## Context

**Document image understanding**, is a super actif area in Data science community, known as visually-rich document understanding, where not only the textual information matters, but also the visual aspect and the layout (relative positions of words in the document). Therefore, building a robust models requires a clean and well annotated dataset.

Annotating such dataset, is a heavy task, since every token in the document should be labelized and that requires first the extraction of text using an OCR Engine.

The main objective of this repo is to make the annotation of scanned/image documents much easier
